## What Works ‚úÖ

### Movement Adjudication
- ‚úÖ Simple moves (uncontested, to empty locations)
- ‚úÖ Bounces (head-to-head, multi-way)
- ‚úÖ Move validation (adjacency, terrain, ownership)
- ‚úÖ Move-to-self rejection

### Support System (COMPLETE!)
- ‚úÖ Support order parsing (hold & move)
- ‚úÖ Attack strength calculation (1 + supports)
- ‚úÖ Defense strength calculation (1 + hold supports)
- ‚úÖ Dislodgement detection (attack > defense)
- ‚úÖ Support cutting (attacked unit loses support)
- ‚úÖ Self-dislodgement prevention
- ‚úÖ No cutting of own supports

### Testing & Integration
- ‚úÖ Original DATC tests running against C implementation
- ‚úÖ Result tracking (VOID, BOUNCE, CUT, DISLODGED)
- ‚úÖ Python ‚Üî C binding working
- ‚úÖ 50+ C-specific tests passing

---

## What Doesn't Work ‚ùå

### Major Blockers
1. **Convoy Mechanics** (~40-50 tests)
   - Pathfinding through fleet chains
   - Convoy disruption  
   - Paradox resolution

2. **Split Coasts** (~15 tests)
   - STP, BUL, SPA as single locations
   - Coast-specific adjacencies

3. **Retreat Phase** (~16 tests)
   - All dislodged units currently disbanded
   - No retreat processing

4. **Adjustment Phase** (~18 tests)
   - No builds/disbands
   - Only welfare calculation works

## Next Steps

### This Week
1. ‚úÖ ~~Basic movement~~ DONE
2. ‚úÖ ~~Support mechanics~~ DONE
3. üéØ **Convoy mechanics** (NEXT - 3-5 days)
4. üéØ **Split coasts** (2-3 days)

### Next Week  
5. **Retreat phase** (2-3 days)
6. **Adjustment phase** (3-4 days)
7. **Polish & edge cases** (1-2 days)

**Target**: 100+ tests passing in 2 weeks, all 159 in 3-4 weeks

## How to Run

```bash
# Build C extension
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# Run C-specific tests
pytest tests/diplomacy/c_tests/ -v

# Run DATC tests
pytest tests/diplomacy/original/test_datc.py -k "test_6_a" -v
pytest tests/diplomacy/original/test_datc.py -k "test_6_d" -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/diplomacy/original/test_datc.py::TestDATC::test_6_d_1 -v
```

## Performance

**Current**: Not yet optimized (correctness focus)  
**Estimated vs Python**: ~2-5x faster (basic operations)  
**Target**: 10-100x faster (after optimization)
