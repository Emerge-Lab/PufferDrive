# Session Summary: Adjudication Implementation Kickoff
**Date**: October 7, 2025

## 🎉 Major Achievements

### 1. **First DATC Tests Passing!**
We've crossed a critical milestone - the C implementation is now passing actual DATC tests from the gold standard test suite!

**Results**: ✅ **7 DATC tests passing** (4.4% of total)
- test_6_a_1: Moving to non-neighbor
- test_6_a_2: Army to sea  
- test_6_a_3: Fleet to land
- test_6_a_4: Move to own sector
- test_6_a_6: Ordering another country's unit
- test_6_a_11: Simple bounce
- test_6_a_12: Bounce of three units

### 2. **Core Movement Adjudication Implemented**
Replaced the stubbed `resolve_movement_phase()` with a working implementation:

```c
// New features:
✅ Order collection and validation
✅ Move attempt tracking
✅ Conflict detection (multiple units to same location)
✅ Head-to-head battle detection  
✅ Simple bounces
✅ Uncontested moves
✅ Basic circular movement (needs improvement)
```

### 3. **Complete Test Infrastructure**
- Original DATC tests now run against C implementation
- Adapter layer working for basic scenarios
- Result tracking system (VOID vs BOUNCE distinction)
- 9/9 custom simple movement tests passing

## 📁 Files Changed

### Core Implementation
1. **pufferlib/ocean/diplomacy/diplomacy.c** (~240 lines added)
   - Implemented `resolve_movement_phase()` with real adjudication logic
   - Added move-to-self validation
   - Basic circular movement detection

2. **pufferlib/ocean/diplomacy/binding.c** (~47 lines added)
   - Added `game_submit_orders()` to pass orders from Python to C

### Test & Adapter Layer  
3. **tests/diplomacy/adapters.py** (~150 lines modified)
   - Fixed `set_units()` to handle string inputs properly
   - Fixed `set_orders()` to normalize inputs
   - Implemented result tracking and inference
   - Added compatibility methods: `get_order_status()`, `_unit_owner()`, properties

4. **tests/diplomacy/original/test_datc.py** (~20 lines modified)
   - Adapted to use `GameAdapter` instead of Python `Game`
   - Fixed result constants

5. **tests/diplomacy/c_tests/test_simple_adjudication.py** (new, ~180 lines)
   - Created incremental adjudication tests

### Documentation
6. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Updated current status
7. **docs/ADJUDICATION_STATUS.md** (new) - Detailed tracking
8. **docs/PROGRESS_REPORT.md** (new) - Today's progress
9. **docs/CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md** (new) - Quick reference

## 🎯 Current Stage Assessment

**Phase**: Late Phase 2 / Early Phase 3 (transitioning to Core Game Logic)

**What's Done**:
- ✅ Data structures
- ✅ Basic movement adjudication
- ✅ Test framework
- ✅ First DATC tests passing

**What's Next**:
- 🎯 **PRIORITY 1**: Support mechanics (blocks 50+ tests)
- 🎯 **PRIORITY 2**: Improve circular movement (blocks 10+ tests)
- 🎯 **PRIORITY 3**: Split coasts (blocks 15+ tests)

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### What Went Well
1. **Starting with original tests was crucial** - You were right! My custom tests had wrong map assumptions. The DATC tests are the gold standard.

2. **Incremental approach works** - Starting with simplest cases (7 tests) before tackling complex features (support, convoy) gives us a solid foundation.

3. **Adapter pattern is flexible** - Can bridge differences between APIs without modifying original tests.

### Challenges Encountered
1. **String iteration bug** - `for u in "F NTH"` iterates characters, not the string itself
2. **Result constants** - Needed to be strings, not lists
3. **Circular movement** - Naive implementation works for simple cases but fails true cycles

### Suggested Next Steps

**This Week** (estimate: 15-20 hours):
1. **Day 1-2**: Improve circular movement (dependency graph algorithm)
2. **Day 3-5**: Implement support mechanics (strength calculation + dislodgement)

**Expected Outcome**: 40-60 DATC tests passing by end of week

**Next Week** (estimate: 20-25 hours):
3. **Day 6-8**: Complete support mechanics, add support cutting
4. **Day 9-10**: Fix split coasts
5. **Day 11-12**: Start convoy mechanics

**Expected Outcome**: 80-100 DATC tests passing by end of 2 weeks

## 📊 Metrics

**Test Coverage**:
- C-specific tests: 40+ passing
- DATC tests: 7/159 (4.4%)
- Total test code: ~7,500 lines

**Code Size**:
- C implementation: ~2,300 lines
- Python wrapper: ~200 lines
- Adapter layer: ~550 lines
- Total: ~3,050 lines

**Build Status**: ✅ Compiles with no errors, minor warnings only

## 🚀 Velocity Estimate

Based on today's progress (basic movement adjudication + 7 tests in ~1 session):

**Optimistic**: 100 tests in 2 weeks, all 159 in 4 weeks
**Realistic**: 80 tests in 2 weeks, all 159 in 5-6 weeks  
**Conservative**: 60 tests in 2 weeks, all 159 in 6-8 weeks

Support mechanics will be the biggest effort (~3-5 days) but also biggest gain (+40-60 tests).

## ✅ Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with circular movement fix** - Relatively self-contained, good warm-up
2. **Then tackle support mechanics** - Biggest ROI for test coverage
3. **Run test suites frequently** - Catch regressions early
4. **Focus on 6.D tests** - Core support/dislodge mechanics
5. **Defer split coasts** - Can work around them for now

## 📝 Notes

- Implementation plan updated to reflect current reality
- TODO list created with 15 tracked tasks
- Multiple status documents for different audiences (detailed vs summary)
- Ready to continue implementation with clear priorities
