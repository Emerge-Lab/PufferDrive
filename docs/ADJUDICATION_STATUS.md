## Implementation Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Basic Movement (Current)
**Target**: Pass 6.A tests (basic validity)

**Implementation needed**:
1. ✅ Parse HOLD and MOVE orders
2. ✅ Validate adjacency and unit ownership
3. ⏳ Resolve uncontested moves
4. ⏳ Detect head-to-head collisions
5. ⏳ Implement simple bounces (no support)
6. ⏳ Update unit positions after successful moves

**Expected DATC**: 20-30 tests passing

### Milestone 2: Support Mechanics
**Target**: Pass 6.D tests (supports and dislodges)

**Implementation needed**:
1. Calculate attack strength (1 + number of valid supports)
2. Calculate defense strength
3. Determine dislodgements when attack > defense
4. Support cutting rules (attacked unit loses support)
5. Self-dislodgment prevention
6. Beleaguered garrison rules

**Expected DATC**: 50-80 tests passing

### Milestone 3: Split Coasts
**Target**: Pass 6.B tests (coastal issues)

**Implementation needed**:
1. Model split coasts as separate locations (or track coast in unit)
2. Update adjacency for coast-specific moves
3. Coast specification in orders (SPA/NC, STP/SC, etc.)
4. Default coast selection rules

**Expected DATC**: 70-90 tests passing

### Milestone 4: Convoy Mechanics
**Target**: Pass 6.F, 6.G tests (convoys)

**Implementation needed**:
1. Multi-fleet convoy pathfinding
2. Convoy disruption (dislodged fleet breaks convoy)
3. Attacked but not dislodged convoy still works
4. Convoy to adjacent places (intent detection)
5. Paradox resolution (Szykman rule)

**Expected DATC**: 110-130 tests passing

### Milestone 5: Retreat Phase
**Target**: Pass 6.H tests (retreating)

**Implementation needed**:
1. Calculate valid retreat destinations
2. Exclude attacker's origin
3. Exclude contested locations
4. Handle multiple retreats to same location (all disband)
5. Update phase to handle retreat phases correctly

**Expected DATC**: 140-150 tests passing

### Milestone 6: Adjustment Phase
**Target**: Pass 6.I, 6.J tests (building/disbanding)

**Implementation needed**:
1. Build validation (home center, owned, empty)
2. Disband mechanics
3. Civil disorder rules (auto-disband by distance/alphabetical)
4. Welfare-specific: voluntary disbands

**Expected DATC**: 155-159 tests passing

### Milestone 7: Polish & Edge Cases
**Target**: 100% DATC pass rate

**Implementation needed**:
1. Fix any remaining edge cases
2. Ensure all paradox scenarios work correctly
3. Performance optimization after correctness

## Known Limitations

### Current Iteration (Iteration 3)
- **No adjudication**: All orders resolve as holds
- **No support**: Support orders are parsed but not processed
- **No convoys**: Convoy orders are parsed but not processed
- **No retreats**: Retreat phase skipped (no dislodgements yet)
- **No builds/disbands**: Adjustment phase only calculates welfare
- **Split coasts**: Not modeled (STP, BUL, SPA treated as single locations)

### Planned for Future Iterations
- **Action space**: Currently placeholder (1000 actions, but not mapped)
- **Observations**: Minimal encoding (175 dims), needs enrichment
- **Get possible orders**: Currently returns empty
- **Circular movement detection**: Not implemented
- **Convoy paradoxes**: Not implemented

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Current)
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Use C-specific tests in `tests/diplomacy/c_tests/`
- Focus on order parsing and validation

### Phase 2: Simple Scenarios
- Create minimal test cases (2-3 units)
- Test basic moves, bounces, supports
- Build confidence before DATC

### Phase 3: DATC Section by Section
1. Start with 6.A (basic validity) - easiest
2. Then 6.D (supports) - core mechanics
3. Then 6.E (head to head) - builds on 6.D
4. Then 6.C (circular) - complex interactions
5. Save 6.B (coasts) for after split coast fix
6. Save 6.F/G (convoys) for later - most complex

### Phase 4: Full DATC Suite
- Run all 159 tests
- Fix failures systematically
- Track regression

## Debug Aids

### Logging Levels (to be implemented)
```c
#define DEBUG_ORDERS      1  // Log parsed orders
#define DEBUG_VALIDATION  2  // Log validation results
#define DEBUG_RESOLUTION  3  // Log resolution steps
#define DEBUG_STRENGTH    4  // Log strength calculations
```

### Helper Functions Needed
```c
void print_game_state(GameState* game);
void print_unit_positions(GameState* game);
void print_order(Order* order);
void print_combat_results(Combat* combats, int num_combats);
```

## Performance Notes

**Correctness First**: All optimization deferred until 100% DATC pass rate achieved.

**Future Optimizations**:
- Pre-computed order lookup tables
- Bitboard representation for unit positions
- SIMD for parallel combat resolution
- Thread pool for vectorized environments
