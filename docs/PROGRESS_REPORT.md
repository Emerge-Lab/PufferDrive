# Implementation Progress Report
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Phase**: Early Phase 3 - Core Game Logic

## Summary

We've successfully implemented basic movement adjudication and are now passing the first set of DATC tests!

### Key Achievements

1. **✅ Basic Movement Adjudication Implemented**
   - Simple uncontested moves work
   - Head-to-head bounces detected
   - Multi-way bounces work
   - Invalid moves (non-adjacent, wrong terrain) rejected
   - Move-to-self validation added

2. **✅ Test Infrastructure Working**
   - C-specific tests: 9/9 passing in `test_simple_adjudication.py`
   - Original DATC tests adapted to use C implementation
   - Result inference system working (VOID vs BOUNCE detection)
   - Adapter layer functional for basic scenarios

3. **✅ DATC Test Results**
   - **7/7 passing**: test_6_a_1, 6_a_2, 6_a_3, 6_a_4, 6_a_6, 6_a_11, 6_a_12
   - These cover: invalid moves, basic bounces, ordering other's units
   - **0/3 passing**: test_6_c_1, 6_c_2, 6_c_3 (circular movement)

## What Works Now

### C Implementation
- ✅ Order parsing (HOLD, MOVE, SUPPORT, CONVOY structure)
- ✅ Order validation (adjacency, terrain, ownership)
- ✅ Basic movement resolution
  - Uncontested moves succeed
  - Multiple units to same destination bounce
  - Head-to-head battles bounce (equal strength)
  - Invalid orders stay in place
- ✅ Phase progression (Spring/Fall/Winter)
- ✅ Year tracking and max_years game over

### Python Adapter
- ✅ set_units() handles string and list inputs
- ✅ set_orders() handles string and list inputs
- ✅ process() submits orders to C
- ✅ Result inference (VOID vs BOUNCE)
- ✅ Unit position tracking
- ✅ Phase and year queries
- ✅ Basic hashing for game state

## What Doesn't Work Yet

### Critical Missing Features

1. **Circular Movement** (blocking ~10+ DATC tests)
   - Current implementation too naive
   - Needs proper dependency graph resolution
   - Example: ANK→CON→SMY→ANK should all move (currently bounces)

   - Support parsing exists
   - Support validation exists
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Support strength calculation
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Dislodgement detection
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Support cutting

3. **Split Coasts** (blocking ~15+ DATC tests)
   - STP/NC vs STP/SC
   - BUL/EC vs BUL/SC
   - SPA/NC vs SPA/SC
   - Currently treated as single locations

4. **Convoy Mechanics** (blocking ~40+ DATC tests)
   - Convoy parsing exists
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Convoy pathfinding
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Convoy disruption
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Paradox resolution

5. **Retreat Phase** (blocking ~15+ DATC tests)
   - Phase exists but stubbed
   - No retreat destination calculation
   - No retreat validation

6. **Adjustment Phase** (blocking ~20+ DATC tests)
   - Only welfare calculation implemented
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Build validation and execution
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Disband validation and execution
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED: Civil disorder rules

## Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Improve Circular Movement (1-2 days)
The current circular movement algorithm is too simple. Need to implement proper dependency resolution:

**Algorithm needed**:
```
1. Build dependency graph (unit A needs unit B to move first)
2. Detect cycles in graph
3. If cycle is consistent (no external blockers), resolve it
4. If cycle has conflicting move (e.g., two units wanting same destination), break it
```

**Expected gain**: +10-15 DATC tests

### Priority 2: Implement Support Mechanics (3-5 days)
This is the BIGGEST feature gap blocking ~50 DATC tests:

**Implementation**:
```c
// In resolve_movement_phase():
// 1. Parse support orders for all powers
// 2. Validate supports (supporter adjacent to dest, not attacking own unit)
// 3. Calculate attack strength: 1 + valid_supports
// 4. Calculate defense strength: 1 + valid_hold_supports
// 5. Determine dislodgements: if attack_strength > defense_strength
// 6. Apply moves and record dislodged units
// 7. Support cutting: attacked unit loses support
```

**Expected gain**: +40-60 DATC tests

### Priority 3: Fix Split Coasts (2-3 days)
Model STP, BUL, SPA as having multiple coast variants:

**Options**:
- Add coast field to Unit and Location
- OR: Treat coasts as separate locations (STP_NC, STP_SC)
- Update adjacency cache for coast-specific moves

**Expected gain**: +10-15 DATC tests

### Priority 4: Convoy Mechanics (5-7 days)
Most complex feature:
- Pathfinding through fleet chains
- Convoy disruption detection
- Paradox resolution (Szykman rule)

**Expected gain**: +30-40 DATC tests

## Performance Notes

Current implementation is focused purely on correctness. No optimizations have been applied.

Estimated current performance vs Python: **~2-5x faster** (rough guess)
- Simple moves are fast
- No support/convoy overhead yet
- Once complete: expect 10-100x speedup

## Build Status

✅ Compiles cleanly with only minor warnings
✅ No memory leaks detected (in basic testing)
✅ Can run hundreds of test iterations without crashes

## Conclusion

**Strong foundation established!** Basic movement adjudication is working and we're passing initial DATC tests. The next major milestone is implementing support mechanics, which will unlock the majority of remaining tests.

Current trajectory: **On track** for 50+ DATC tests passing within 1 week, 100+ within 2 weeks.
