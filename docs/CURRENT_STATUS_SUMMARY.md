# Current Implementation Status - Summary

## 🎯 Where We Are

**Phase**: Early Phase 3 (Core Game Logic) - Basic Movement Working

**Major Milestone**: ✅ **First DATC tests passing!** (7/159)

## 📊 Test Results

### C-Specific Tests
- ✅ **9/9** simple movement tests passing
- ✅ **40+** total C-specific tests passing
- ⏸️ Advanced features skipped (support, convoy, welfare)

### Original DATC Tests  
- ✅ **7 tests passing** (test_6_a_1, 6_a_2, 6_a_3, 6_a_4, 6_a_6, 6_a_11, 6_a_12)
- ❌ **3 tests failing** (circular movement tests)
- 📦 **149 tests** not yet attempted (require support/convoy/retreats/adjustments)

## ✅ What's Working

### Adjudication Engine
```
✅ Parse orders (HOLD, MOVE, SUPPORT*, CONVOY*)
✅ Validate orders (ownership, adjacency, terrain)
✅ Resolve simple moves
✅ Detect head-to-head bounces
✅ Detect multi-way bounces  
✅ Reject invalid moves (VOID)
⏳ Basic circular movement (needs improvement)
```
*Structure only, not adjudicated yet

### Test Infrastructure
```
✅ GameAdapter working with original tests
✅ Result tracking (VOID vs BOUNCE)
✅ Unit position tracking
✅ Order submission from Python to C
✅ Phase progression
```

## ❌ What's Not Working

### High Priority
1. **Circular Movement** - Naive implementation, fails proper cycles
2. **Support Adjudication** - No strength calculation or dislodgement
3. **Convoy Adjudication** - Not implemented
4. **Retreat Phase** - Stubbed
5. **Adjustment Phase** - Only welfare calc, no builds/disbands

### Medium Priority
6. **Split Coasts** - STP, BUL, SPA treated as single locations
7. **Result Details** - No CUT, DISLODGED, NO_CONVOY, DISRUPTED tracking
8. **Get Possible Orders** - Returns empty

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### This Week
1. **Improve circular movement algorithm** (1-2 days)
   - Implement dependency graph
   - Detect and resolve consistent cycles
   - Target: Pass test_6_c_1, 6_c_2, 6_c_3

2. **Start support mechanics** (3-4 days)
   - Calculate attack/defense strength
   - Implement dislodgement
   - Support cutting rules
   - Target: Pass 20-30 DATC tests from 6.D section

### Next Week
3. **Complete support mechanics**
4. **Fix split coasts**
5. **Start convoy mechanics**

## 📈 Progress Metrics

**Lines of Code**:
- C implementation: ~2,300 lines
- Test code: ~7,500 lines
- Adapter code: ~550 lines

**DATC Coverage**: 4.4% (7/159)
**Estimated Completion**: 
- 50 tests: ~1 week
- 100 tests: ~2-3 weeks
- All 159 tests: ~4-6 weeks

## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **Debug output**: Some fprintf statements still in C code (commented)
2. **Result tracking**: Inference-based, should track directly in C
3. **Adapter complexity**: Growing, may need refactoring
4. **Map data**: Known inaccuracies, need systematic verification

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Rapid Progress
1. Focus on support mechanics next - biggest impact (50+ tests)
2. Defer split coasts until after basic support works
3. Keep circular movement simple for now, improve later
4. Add direct result tracking in C (avoid inference)

### For Code Quality
1. Add result struct to C code (track VOID, BOUNCE, etc. directly)
2. Refactor adapter to be cleaner
3. Add more helper functions for testing
4. Document adjudication algorithm in code comments

## 🚀 Velocity

**Today's Progress**:
- Implemented basic movement adjudication
- Passed first 7 DATC tests
- Created working adapter layer
- Est. ~8 hours of work

**Projected Next Week**:
- Support mechanics: +40-60 DATC tests
- Circular movement fix: +10 DATC tests
- Total: 50-70 tests passing (~35-45% coverage)
