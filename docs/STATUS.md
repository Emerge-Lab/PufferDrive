# Welfare Diplomacy C Port - Status

**Last Updated**: October 13, 2025
**Current**: 80/160 tests passing (50.0%) 🎉
**Goal**: 100 tests → 150+ tests → 160 tests

## Quick Summary

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Tests Passing** | 80/160 (50.0%) ⬆️ +12 from last session |
| **Next Priority** | Split Coast Inference (6.B) → 91 tests |
| **Then** | Convoy Retreats (6.H) → 94 tests |
| **Build** | ✅ Compiles cleanly |
| **Memory** | ✅ No leaks |

## Recent Progress ✨

**Session Accomplishments (68 → 80 tests, +12):**
- ✅ Fixed N-way retreat conflicts (6.H.8) - multiple units retreating to same location
- ✅ Fixed split coast retreat rules (6.H.15, 6.H.16) - blocking all coasts when any coast contested
- ✅ Improved retreat validation - attacker origin checking with parent location support
- ✅ Fixed contested area tracking for split coasts

## What's Working ✅

**Movement & Combat:**
- Order parsing, validation, resolution
- Support mechanics (strength, dislodgement, cutting)
- Head-to-head battles and bounces
- Basic convoy system (58% tests passing)

**Retreat Phase:**
- Valid retreat destination calculation ✅
- Multiple retreats to same location (all disband) ✅
- Attacker origin exclusion (including split coast parents) ✅
- Contested area exclusion (including split coast parents) ✅
- Adjacency validation (no convoy in retreats) ✅
- N-way conflict resolution ✅

**Split Coasts:**
- STP, BUL, SPA with coast variants (/NC, /SC, /EC)
- Coast-specific adjacencies
- Retreat validation with parent location checking

**Core Systems:**
- Map data (85 locations, 34 supply centers)
- Phase progression (Spring/Fall/Winter)
- Power structures (units, centers, orders)
- Python ↔ C bindings
- Test infrastructure (DATC + adapter layer)

## Path to 100 Tests (Current: 80)

### **Phase 1: Split Coast Inference → 91 tests (+11)** 🎯 NEXT
**Target**: Python adapter fix
- Infer unambiguous coast when moving to SPA/BUL/STP without specification
- Example: `F GAS - SPA` should infer `SPA/NC` (only reachable coast)
- **Complexity**: LOW - order normalization logic
- **Location**: `tests/diplomacy/adapters.py`

### **Phase 2: Convoy-Based Retreats → 94 tests (+3)** 🎯
**Target**: Python adapter enhancement
- Track which moves used convoy during movement phase
- Allow retreats to attacker origin if attacker arrived via convoy
- Tests: 6.H.11, 6.H.12, 6.H.13
- **Complexity**: MEDIUM
- **Location**: `tests/diplomacy/adapters.py`

### **Phase 3: Support Validation → 95 tests (+1)** 🎯
**Target**: Python adapter fix
- Mark support as VOID if supported unit isn't moving
- Test: 6.H.14
- **Complexity**: LOW
- **Location**: `tests/diplomacy/adapters.py`

### **Phase 4: Basic Move Validation → 99 tests (+4)** 🎯
**Target**: Python adapter improvements
- Fix convoy-to-same-location (should be VOID)
- Improve void move detection
- Tests: 6.A.5, 6.A.7, 6.A.9, 6.A.10
- **Complexity**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Location**: `tests/diplomacy/adapters.py`

### **Phase 5: Circular Movement → 103 tests (+4)** 🎯 **100+ ACHIEVED!**
**Target**: C core adjudication or Python inference
- Implement cycle detection for moves (A→B→C→A)
- Tests: 6.C.2, 6.C.3, 6.C.4, 6.C.5
- **Complexity**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Location**: `pufferlib/ocean/diplomacy/diplomacy.c` or adapter

**All Phases 1-4 are Python-only fixes - no C changes needed!**

## Path to 150 Tests (100 → 150)

**Requires C adjudication core enhancements:**

### Support Strength & Self-Dislodge (6.D) → 114 tests (+11)
- Prevent self-dislodgement (supporting attack on own unit)
- Fix support strength calculation
- Handle support cutting by convoyed units

### Basic Convoy Logic (6.F) → 121 tests (+7)
- Improve convoy pathfinding
- Handle simple disruption cases

### Beleaguered Garrison (6.E) → 130 tests (+9)
- Unit with equal attacks from multiple sides isn't dislodged
- Complex strength calculation

### Adjacent Convoy Precedence (6.G) → 141 tests (+11)
- When both convoy and land route available, which takes precedence?
- Very complex rule interactions

### Advanced Cases → 150 tests (+9)
- Remaining 6.D, 6.F tests
- Complex paradoxes and edge cases

## Path to 160 Tests (ALL)

**Additional work needed:**
- Adjustment phase improvements (6.I): +4 tests
- Civil disorder handling (6.J): +5 tests
- Custom edge cases (6.K): +2 tests
- Polish remaining: +4 tests

## What's Missing ❌

### High Priority (Blocking 100)
- ✅ ~~Retreat phase basics~~ (DONE!)
- 🎯 Split coast inference (6.B) - **NEXT**
- 🎯 Convoy retreat rules (6.H.11-13)
- 🎯 Support validation (6.H.14)

- 🎯 Circular movement (6.C)

### Medium Priority (Blocking 150)

- Convoy paradox resolution
- Adjacent convoy precedence rules

### Lower Priority
- Adjustment phase polish
- Civil disorder edge cases
- Custom test cases
- Final edge cases
