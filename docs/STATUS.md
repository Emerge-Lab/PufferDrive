## What's Implemented ✅

### Movement Adjudication
- ✅ Order parsing (HOLD, MOVE, SUPPORT, CONVOY structure)
- ✅ Order validation (adjacency, terrain, ownership)
- ✅ Basic movement resolution
  - Uncontested moves succeed
  - Head-to-head battles bounce (equal strength)
  - Multi-way bounces work correctly
  - Invalid moves rejected (VOID)
  - Move-to-self validation
- ✅ Circular movement detection (cycles like A→B, B→C, C→A)
- ✅ Circular swap/cycle resolution (A→B, B→A and A→B, B→C, C→A)
- ✅ Disrupted circular movement detection (external interference)
- ✅ Result inference for swaps (distinguishes moved vs stayed)
- ✅ Support orders in circular movements (non-interfering)
- ✅ 6/7 circular movement tests passing (86%)
- ⏳ Convoy+circular edge case (1 test remaining)

### Convoy Mechanics - WORKING! ✅
- ✅ Convoy order parsing and validation
- ✅ Fleet convoy validation (must be in WATER, not COAST)
- ✅ BFS pathfinding through convoying fleets
- ✅ Army moves via convoy (if valid path exists)
- ✅ Convoy disruption detection (dislodged fleets break convoy)
- ✅ Path re-validation after dislodgements
- ✅ Convoying fleets have defensive strength (can resist attacks)
- ✅ Support cutting by convoys (disrupted convoys don't cut)
- ✅ Result tracking: VOID (no path), NO_CONVOY (disrupted), BOUNCE (failed)
- ✅ Fleet convoy order result tracking (VOID when coastal/invalid)
- ✅ 14/24 convoy tests passing (58%)
- ⏳ Complex scenarios remaining: multi-route convoys, paradoxes (10 tests)

### Support Mechanics (Complete)
- ✅ Support order parsing (hold & move variants)
- ✅ Support validation (adjacency, terrain)
- ✅ Attack strength calculation: 1 + valid supports
- ✅ Defense strength calculation: 1 + hold supports
- ✅ Dislodgement detection: attack > defense
- ✅ Support cutting rules
  - Attacked unit loses support
  - Own units don't cut own supports
  - Dislodged units cut before removal
- ✅ Self-dislodgement prevention
  - Can't support dislodging own unit
  - Checked for both attacker and supporter
  - Prevents return-path self-dislodgement

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Original DATC tests running against C implementation
- ✅ Result tracking (OK, VOID, BOUNCE, CUT, DISLODGED)
- ✅ Adapter layer for Python test compatibility
- ✅ Python ↔ C binding working correctly
- ✅ Dislodgement tracking from C

### Core Systems
- ✅ Phase progression (Spring/Fall/Winter)
- ✅ Year tracking and max_years game over
- ✅ Map data (76 locations, 34 supply centers)
- ✅ Adjacency cache for movement validation
- ✅ Power structures (units, centers, orders)
- ✅ Welfare point calculation (basic)

## What's Not Implemented ❌

### Critical Blockers (High Priority)

#### 1. Convoy Mechanics (~40-50 tests blocked)
- ❌ Multi-fleet convoy pathfinding
- ❌ Convoy disruption detection
- ❌ Attacked but not dislodged convoy still works
- ❌ Paradox resolution (Szykman rule)
- ❌ Convoy to adjacent places

**Impact**: Blocks 42 DATC tests (sections 6.F, 6.G) plus many 6.D tests

#### 2. Split Coasts (~15 tests blocked)
- ❌ STP/NC vs STP/SC (St Petersburg)
- ❌ BUL/EC vs BUL/SC (Bulgaria)
- ❌ SPA/NC vs SPA/SC (Spain)
- ❌ Coast-specific adjacencies
- ❌ Coast specification in orders

**Impact**: Blocks all 6.B tests plus some 6.D/6.E tests

#### 3. Retreat Phase (~16 tests blocked)
- ❌ Valid retreat destination calculation
- ❌ Retreat order processing
- ❌ Multiple retreats to same location (all disband)
- ❌ Exclude attacker origin and contested locations

**Impact**: Blocks all 6.H tests

#### 4. Adjustment Phase (~18 tests blocked)
- ❌ Build validation (home center, owned, empty)
- ❌ Build execution
- ❌ Disband validation and execution
- ❌ Civil disorder rules (auto-disband)
- ❌ Welfare-specific voluntary disbands

**Impact**: Blocks all 6.I and 6.J tests, prevents complete games

### Medium Priority

#### 5. Circular Movement (1 edge case remaining)
- ✅ Basic circular swaps working (2-way and 3-way)
- ✅ Disrupted circular movements handled correctly
- ✅ Support orders in circular movements
- ⏳ Convoy + circular movement combination (1 test)

**Impact**: 6/7 tests passing, minimal blocker

#### 6. Advanced Features (Deferred)
- ❌ Get possible orders (returns empty)
- ❌ Action space mapping (placeholder)
- ❌ Observation encoding (minimal 175-dim)
- ❌ Valid action mask

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Split coasts not modeled** - STP, BUL, SPA treated as single locations
2. **No convoy pathfinding** - Convoy orders parsed but not adjudicated
3. **Retreat phase stubbed** - All dislodged units immediately disbanded
4. **Adjustment phase minimal** - Only welfare calculation, no builds/disbands
5. **Circular movement naive** - Works for simple cases, fails complex cycles
6. **Result tracking inference-based** - Should track directly in C (technical debt)

### Map Data
- 76 locations correctly loaded ✅
- 34 supply centers identified ✅
- Adjacency cache functional ✅
- Some adjacency data may need verification (ongoing)

### Adapter Layer
- Works well for basic scenarios ✅
- Growing complexity, may need refactoring
- Some edge cases need handling

## Recent Changes

### October 8, 2025 - Circular Movement Milestone
**Progress**: 54 → 55 DATC tests passing (2/7 → 6/7 circular movement)

**Added:**
- Circular movement result inference (swap detection)
- Support order VOID detection for circular movements
- Distinguishes successful swaps from failed circular movements
- Handles 2-way swaps (A↔B) and 3-way cycles (A→B→C→A)
- Detects external disruption of circular movements

**Fixed:**
- Move order result tracking now checks if unit actually moved
- Support orders no longer marked VOID when destination unit is moving away
- Swap detection verifies other unit left its source position
- Prevents false positives where destination was already occupied

**Files Modified:**
- `adapters.py`: ~40 lines added for swap/cycle detection logic

**Test Progress:**
- 6.C (Circular Movement): 2/7 → 6/7 (86%)
- Only remaining failure: convoy+circular edge case
