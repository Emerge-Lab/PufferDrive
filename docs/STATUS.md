## What's Implemented ✅

### Movement Adjudication
- ✅ Order parsing (HOLD, MOVE, SUPPORT, CONVOY structure)
- ✅ Order validation (adjacency, terrain, ownership)
- ✅ Basic movement resolution
  - Uncontested moves succeed
  - Head-to-head battles bounce (equal strength)
  - Multi-way bounces work correctly
  - Invalid moves rejected (VOID)
  - Move-to-self validation
- ✅ Circular movement detection (cycles like A→B, B→C, C→A)
- ✅ Circular swap/cycle resolution (A→B, B→A and A→B, B→C, C→A)
- ✅ Disrupted circular movement detection (external interference)
- ✅ Result inference for swaps (distinguishes moved vs stayed)
- ✅ Support orders in circular movements (non-interfering)
- ✅ 6/7 circular movement tests passing (86%)
- ⏳ Convoy+circular edge case (1 test remaining)

### Convoy Mechanics - WORKING! ✅
- ✅ Convoy order parsing and validation
- ✅ Fleet convoy validation (must be in WATER, not COAST)
- ✅ BFS pathfinding through convoying fleets
- ✅ Army moves via convoy (if valid path exists)
- ✅ Convoy disruption detection (dislodged fleets break convoy)
- ✅ Path re-validation after dislodgements
- ✅ Convoying fleets have defensive strength (can resist attacks)
- ✅ Support cutting by convoys (disrupted convoys don't cut)
- ✅ Result tracking: VOID (no path), NO_CONVOY (disrupted), BOUNCE (failed)
- ✅ Fleet convoy order result tracking (VOID when coastal/invalid)
- ✅ 14/24 convoy tests passing (58%)
- ⏳ Complex scenarios remaining: multi-route convoys, paradoxes (10 tests)

### Split Coasts - WORKING! ✅
- ✅ Three split coast territories: STP, BUL, SPA
- ✅ Coast variants modeled: /NC, /SC, /EC (9 new location entries)
- ✅ Generic land connections for armies (stp, bul, spa)
- ✅ Coast-specific adjacencies for fleets
- ✅ Order parsing handles coast specifications (e.g., "F POR - SPA/NC")
- ✅ Ambiguous moves correctly marked VOID (e.g., "F POR - SPA")
- ✅ Coast auto-detection when only one reachable
- ✅ Parent location tracking for supply center ownership
- ✅ Helper functions: find_coasts(), default_coast(), is_coast_required()
- ✅ 3/14 split coast tests passing (21%)
- ⏳ Remaining tests involve retreat/build phase interactions (11 tests)

### Support Mechanics (Complete)
- ✅ Support order parsing (hold & move variants)
- ✅ Support validation (adjacency, terrain)
- ✅ Attack strength calculation: 1 + valid supports
- ✅ Defense strength calculation: 1 + hold supports
- ✅ Dislodgement detection: attack > defense
- ✅ Support cutting rules
  - Attacked unit loses support
  - Own units don't cut own supports
  - Dislodged units cut before removal
- ✅ Self-dislodgement prevention
  - Can't support dislodging own unit
  - Checked for both attacker and supporter
  - Prevents return-path self-dislodgement

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Original DATC tests running against C implementation
- ✅ Result tracking (OK, VOID, BOUNCE, CUT, DISLODGED)
- ✅ Adapter layer for Python test compatibility
- ✅ Python ↔ C binding working correctly
- ✅ Dislodgement tracking from C

### Core Systems
- ✅ Phase progression (Spring/Fall/Winter)
- ✅ Year tracking and max_years game over
- ✅ Map data (85 locations incl. split coasts, 34 supply centers)
- ✅ Adjacency cache for movement validation
- ✅ Power structures (units, centers, orders)
- ✅ Welfare point calculation (basic)

## What's Not Implemented ❌

### Critical Blockers (High Priority)

#### 1. Retreat Phase (~16 tests blocked)
- ❌ Valid retreat destination calculation
- ❌ Retreat order processing
- ❌ Multiple retreats to same location (all disband)
- ❌ Exclude attacker origin and contested locations

**Impact**: Blocks all 6.H tests

#### 2. Adjustment Phase (~18 tests blocked)
- ❌ Build validation (home center, owned, empty)
- ❌ Build execution
- ❌ Disband validation and execution
- ❌ Civil disorder rules (auto-disband)
- ❌ Welfare-specific voluntary disbands

**Impact**: Blocks all 6.I and 6.J tests, prevents complete games

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Circular Movement (1 edge case remaining)
- ✅ Basic circular swaps working (2-way and 3-way)
- ✅ Disrupted circular movements handled correctly
- ✅ Support orders in circular movements
- ⏳ Convoy + circular movement combination (1 test)

**Impact**: 6/7 tests passing, minimal blocker

#### 4. Advanced Features (Deferred)
- ❌ Get possible orders (returns empty)
- ❌ Action space mapping (placeholder)
- ❌ Observation encoding (minimal 175-dim)
- ❌ Valid action mask

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Retreat phase stubbed** - All dislodged units immediately disbanded
2. **Adjustment phase minimal** - Only welfare calculation, no builds/disbands
3. **Circular movement edge case** - Works for most cases, 1 convoy+circular test failing
4. **Result tracking inference-based** - Should track directly in C (technical debt)
5. **Convoy paradoxes** - Basic Szykman rule, complex multi-route cases remaining

### Map Data
- 85 locations correctly loaded (76 base + 9 split coast variants) ✅
- 34 supply centers identified ✅
- Split coasts implemented: STP, BUL, SPA ✅
- Adjacency cache functional ✅
- Coast-specific adjacencies verified ✅

### Adapter Layer
- Works well for basic scenarios ✅
- Growing complexity, may need refactoring
- Some edge cases need handling

**Progress**: 58 → 68 DATC tests passing (+17% improvement)

**Added:**
- Complete split coast system for STP, BUL, SPA
- 9 new location entries (bul, BUL/EC, BUL/SC, spa, SPA/NC, SPA/SC, stp, STP/NC, STP/SC)
- CoastType enum and parent_location tracking
- Coast-specific adjacency lists for all neighboring locations

- Order parsing for coast specifications ("F POR - SPA/NC")
- Ambiguous move detection ("F POR - SPA" → VOID)
- Generic land connections for armies (lowercase stp/bul/spa)

**Updated:**
- `diplomacy.h`: Expanded MAX_LOCATIONS (76→85), MAX_LOCATION_NAME_LENGTH (4→8)
- `diplomacy.c`: +600 lines for split coast data and logic
- `adapters.py`: Case preservation for generic land connections
- Map adjacencies: All neighbors of split coast territories updated

**Test Progress:**
